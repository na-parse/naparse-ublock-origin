# Personal uBlock Origin Filters

This is a repo to track and publish my personal uBlock Origin filter configuration.  Primarily derived around making the forsaken dumpster fire that is YouTube more useful.

## Notable Filter Objectives
- No YouTube Shorts
- Legacy Style Thumbnail Grid layout (4+ per row)
- No "Mix", "Podcast", etc auto-generated playlists
- Remove the overlay in-thumbnail buttons
- No miniplayer (only hides it, can still cause interactivity issues)
- Did I mention no shorts?!
- Removes Auto-Dubbed videos from home, suggestions, etc
